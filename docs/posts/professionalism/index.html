      </style><p>Having worked as a software engineer for a few years, it turns out software engineering is a profession like many others:
you are part of a team with fellow humans, and working to achieve something in a collaborative fashion.</p>
<p>I find it important that we enjoy working with each other.
I would like to be a reliable, cooperative, and helpful coworker.
In short, I would like to be a professional (but never boring) version of myself.
In this blog post, I would like to share some habits and ideas that I have learned to embrace over the years.
Not everyone may find these habits useful, though I hope they can give some inspiration!</p>
<h2 id="review-and-reflection">Review and Reflection</h2>
<p>As professionals, we should be striving to deliver the best work we can (given our skills and resources).
Unfortunately, our brains do not always work towards this goal.
Sometimes the brain gets lost in details, and sometimes it glances over an essential piece of the solution.
I have the feeling that my brain works rather sloppily most of the time, despite pretending to be fully focused.
How are we supposed to deliver a clean and correct implementation if our brains work against us?</p>
<p>The trick I use is simple: Before I ask a colleague to review my work, I first give it a quick review myself. This trick applies to code as well as any other written output (e.g., design proposals or incident reports).
Almost always, I spot some leftovers, inconsistencies, or other shenanigans that my brain seemingly ignored.</p>
<p>Reading through the diff before pushing code to review brings lots of value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coworkers are less likely to encounter distractions, allowing them to focus on more fundamental issues (e.g., correctness and maintainability of the solution).
Automated tools can already catch some distractions, but they are mostly limited to syntax and formatting issues.</li>
<li>Catching some issues early might save an additional round-trip time between the author and the reviewer.</li>
<li>Personally, I gain a more holistic view of my code. This allows me to document certain decisions explicitly before asking for a review.</li>
<li>Finally, I feel good for detecting and fixing the mess I created a few minutes ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure if self-reviewing code works for everyone—but I can recommend trying it.
Even a quick glance might already be beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-and-communication">Ownership and Communication</h2>
<p>Shockingly, even the most thorough tests and reviews allow bugs and other issues to slip through.
This will happen to any professional engineer at some point—and that is completely fine.
Our reaction to such an issue is the important part.
For example, when an immediate incident or bug appears, I attempt to react like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate that an issue may have appeared.</li>
<li>Assume that one of my recent changes may be related to the issue.</li>
<li>Verify the scope of the issue and investigate the cause.</li>
<li>Fix the issue or involve other engineers as needed.</li>
<li>Write a report that analyzes the root cause and possible actions to prevent the issue in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication is crucial here—even if we are initially unsure about the scope of the issue.
Some issues later turn out to be non-issues.
It is not productive to be alarmist, but communicating a potential problem early shows respect to other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not everyone is aware of all the technical details—so communicate appropriately for your target audience.
Most stakeholders will not care about a spike in database replication lag.
Nonetheless, they <em>will</em> care about users not receiving up-to-date data.</p>
<h2 id="appreciating-feedback">Appreciating Feedback</h2>
<p>How did I learn about ownership and communication?
A few years back, when I was an intern, I had only ever coded for fun.
Back then, no one cared about the correctness of my code, how clean it was, or if anyone would understand it in the future.</p>
<p>A few months into my internship, I received feedback about a formatting issue (no linter was part of the CI pipeline, but that&rsquo;s not my point).
The reviewer suggested that I check my code for such issues before asking for reviews, including this line that stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This should be a habit for a professional.
<em>—The reviewer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reviewer&rsquo;s feedback was honest, direct, and yet constructive: the reviewer did not blame the intern for writing bad code.
Instead, they gave me a concrete suggestion on how to improve the quality of my code in the future.
As you, the dear reader, already know, I turned self-reviews into a habit after receiving this feedback.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-humble-coworker">Being a Humble Coworker</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to remember one thing: professionalism is about humans, not computers.
We should strive to give honest feedback, and be open to receiving feedback ourselves.
It is important to have difficult conversations and arguments–but we should not have them negatively interfere with the person behind them.</p>
<p>If you would like to give me some (positive or negative!) feedback on my blog post, please feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ppati000">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-petrovic/">LinkedIn</a> (only if you are a <em>true</em> professional). Looking forward!</p>
