I live in Berlin, Germany.
I am currently working on chat automation at [Charles](https://hello-charles.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.
Previously, I was the Lead Backend Engineer @ [Jodel](https://jodel.com), a German social network.
I have a master's degree in computer science from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/).

Apart from drinking tea and reading Hacker News comments, I love to code for fun. Check out [Ryggio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ryggio-party-game/id1451639042) â€“ made by two friends of mine from Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª and me.
