I am a software engineer based in Germany and currently working in backend @ [Jodel](https://jodel.com). I'm also pursuing a master's degree in computer science @ [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/).

Apart from drinking tea and reading Hacker News comments of highly varying quality, I love to code for fun. Check out [Ryggio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ryggio-party-game/id1451639042) for example – made by two lovely Swedish friends and me!
